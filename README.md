## Usage

Once the package is installed, you can start using it in your project. Here are some examples:

### Generate a Wallet

Generate a new wallet with a mnemonic, private key, and public key:
```javascript
import { WalletUtils } from "@aliezzahn/web3-utils";

const wallet = WalletUtils.generateWallet();
console.log("Mnemonic:", wallet.mnemonic);
console.log("Private Key:", wallet.privateKey);
console.log("Public Key:", wallet.publicKey);
console.log("Address:", wallet.address);
```

### Sign and Verify a Message (Soon)

Sign a message with a private key and verify the signature:
```javascript
const privateKey = "0xYourPrivateKey"; // Replace with your private key
const message = "Hello, Web3!";

// Sign the message
const signature = await WalletUtils.signMessage(privateKey, message);
console.log("Signature:", signature);

// Verify the signature
const recoveredAddress = await WalletUtils.verifyMessage(message, signature);
console.log("Recovered Address:", recoveredAddress);
```

### Interact with a Smart Contract (Soon)

Connect to a smart contract and call a function:
```javascript
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { WalletUtils } from "@aliezzahn/web3-utils";

// Set up a provider (e.g., Infura)
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID");

// Define the contract address and ABI
const contractAddress = "0xYourContractAddress"; // Replace with your contract address
const abi = ["function example() view returns (uint256)"]; // Replace with your contract ABI

// Get the contract instance
const contract = WalletUtils.getContract(contractAddress, abi, provider);

// Call a contract function
const result = await contract.example();
console.log("Result:", result);
```

## FAQs

### 1. What is a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)?
A PAT is a secure way to authenticate with GitHub services. It acts like a password but with specific permissions (e.g., read packages).

### 2. Do I need an npm account?
No, you donâ€™t need an npm account to install this package from GitHub Packages. However, if the package is published to npm, you can install it directly using npm.

### 3. How do I generate a private key?
You can use the `WalletUtils.generateWallet()` method to generate a new wallet, which includes a private key.

### 4. What is an ABI?
An ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a JSON file that defines how to interact with a smart contract. It includes details about the contract's functions and parameters.
